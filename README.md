# SnakeGame

I started this project back in 2019 to begin learning javascript and web development. This project uses the P5.js library for the game details. 

Credit to The Coding Train's Tutorial video which I followed to start off this project.

After 3 years I decided to come back to the project and add HTML and CSS to learn more about Web Development
