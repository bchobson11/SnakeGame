# SnakeGame

I Started this project back in 2019 to kickstart my journey in web development and learn JavaScript. This project utilizes the [P5.js](https://p5js.org/) library for the game details, and I owe credit to The Coding Train's [tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaGK-fj-BAM) that I followed to get started. After completing the tutorial, I proceeded to add on features and customize the look of the game. 

After three years, I decided to revisit the project and expand my knowledge of web development by incorporating HTML and CSS. It's been an exciting journey, and I've learned valuable lessons along the way.

Check out the live demo of this project: [Live Demo](https://bchobson11.github.io/SnakeGame/). 

Feel free to explore and provide any feedback or suggestions.
